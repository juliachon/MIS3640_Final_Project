		This pie chart shows the room type variation in Boston. 63.7% of all the airbnb listings are entire homes/apartments, with 35% of the listings being private rooms. Hence, it can make it easier for Airbnb hosts to see the most popular listings and decide to offer an entire apartment rather than a shared room. On the other hand, a risk averse airbnb host could opt for private or shared listings and make more of these untouched listings segments. For an airbnb user, they can see that the hosts in Boston offer entire homes/apartments and could look further into super hosts of these popular listings.

		The correlation matrix shows the correlation between the variables for the regression model. The diagonal line of 1â€™s indicates that the variables are perfectly correlated with itself, as expected. All missing data and errors were dealt with in the cleaning of the data. We found out that the most correlated variables were minimum nights and availability and the most negatively correlated variables were minimum nights and the number of reviews. Since price was the dependent variable, it was excluded from the correlation.
